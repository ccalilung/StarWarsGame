# unit-4-game

This is the unit-4-game for the GWU Bootcamp May 2018 session. Game is for educational purposes only.

Instructions: Select a character below. The other 3 will become the enemy team. Select a member of the enemy team. When
                    you click the "Attack" button, the enemy's Health Points (HP) will go down by a certain amount. If you
                    don't defeat them in that turn, they will have the opportunity to attack you and your HP will go down
                    as well. As you progress, your attacks get stronger. Once you defeat your opponent, that opponent will
                    move to the "Defeated Enemies" area and you'll be able to select another opponent. If you lose all of
                    your HP, the game is over.
